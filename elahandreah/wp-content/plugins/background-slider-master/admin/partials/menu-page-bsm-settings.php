<h3>FAQ &amp; Troubleshooting</h3>
<h4>Q1. Background Slider image is covered behind other elements.</h4>
<p>
A. The background images are loaded as the first element under the  &lt;head&gt; section, but it is given z-index value of 0. Please make sure there are no html elements, such as &lt;body&gt; or &lt;div&gt; with background color or image specified in CSS.
